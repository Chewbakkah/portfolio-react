        <br />
        My name is Cheyne Ashley Etie. My middle name is from my grandfather on
        my dad's side, and my first name is from Cheyne Horan, a surfer from the
        80's. 1-in-20 pronounce my first name right on the first try. It is
        pronounced "Shane" and if you're over 60 you're probably thinking in
        your head "Come back Shane" right now. Its ok.

        <span className="sub-heading">Location:</span>
        <br />I grew up in small town Texas. Bay City made me realize small town
        life is not for me. For college I attended Abilene Christian University
        in Abilene, Texas. A HUGE town for me at the time. In Abilene I met my
        wife, Caity, and shortly after we married we moved back to Bay City.
        Caity threatened to leave me if our time in Bay City was long, so after
        6 months we moved to Houston and have been big city folk ever since.
        <br /><br />
        <span className="sub-heading">Education:</span><br />
        After attending high school in Bay City I enrolled at Abilene Christian University in 2001 where it took me two years to learn how to ACTUALLY study. I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science degree in Digital Media from the school of Journalism and Mass Communication. This is a long way of saying I learned how to work in Media. More recently I've completed a continuing education course through The University of Texas at Austin in Full Stack Web Development. Aside from some very useful developer skills, I also learned that as and adult, I am fifty times the student I ever was previously.
        <br /><br />
        <span className="sub-heading">Work:</span><br />
        I started working at the very young age of 10, yes 10. My parents instilled a strict work ethic in me early on, and it has benefited me greatly. My first job was emptying trash and vacuuming the church auditorium. Around the age of 13 I was ready to quit and even did, for a week. At that time my mom figured out she didn't want to deal with the vacuuming and hired me on at three times my previous rate. Aside from a six month stretch my freshman year of college, where my job was to "study", I have not spent a day of my life unemployed. I've done everything from janitorial work, fast food, training employees for Texas Roadhouse, carpentry work, to even working as a cashier at Blockbuster, which wasn't as cool as you'd think. I've spent the last 12 years as a graphic designer working at Reynolds and Reynolds, and now I'm looking to expand my skills into Web Development.
        <br /><br />
        <span className="sub-heading">Hobbies:</span><br />
        My favorite hobby that I'll never give up is video games. Aside from that I dabble in some woodworking and competitive sleeping.
