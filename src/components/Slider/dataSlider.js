I also included a cool API for background image randomization because I wanted the app to stand out from the rest.",

PenguinPost was intended to be a clone of Twitter's functionality and was a large project to bite into with only a week and a half alloted to code. The course required us to code in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the back-end was to be MySQL based. We would learn how hard it is to manage a MySQL database for a social network site. The week after this deadline we learned MongoDB and wished we had that tech for this project.",
